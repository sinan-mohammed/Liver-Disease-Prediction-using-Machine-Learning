# 🩺 Liver Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a liver patient dataset and building predictive 
machine learning models to classify whether a patient has liver disease or not.

The study combines:
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
✔ Data Preprocessing  
✔ Multiple ML Classifiers  
✔ Model Comparison  
✔ Streamlit Deployment

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Liver disease cases are increasing due to factors such as alcohol consumption, 
contaminated food intake, drug toxicity, and environmental exposure.

The objective of this project is to:

1️⃣ Perform a complete data analysis  
2️⃣ Build predictive classification models  
3️⃣ Justify model design decisions  
4️⃣ Compare model performances  
5️⃣ Deploy the best model
